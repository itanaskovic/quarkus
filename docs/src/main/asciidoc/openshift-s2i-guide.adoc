= {project-name} - Deploying on OpenShift with S2I

This guide covers:

* The deployment of the application to OpenShift using S2I to build

== Prerequisites

For this guide you need:

* roughly 5 minutes
* having access to an OpenShift cluster. Minishift is a valid option.

== Solution

We recommend to follow the instructions in the next sections and build the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `getting-started` directory.

== Deploying the application in OpenShift

In this section, we are going to leverage the S2I build mechanism of OpenShift.
We use a Java S2I Builder, and therefore do not need a `Dockerfile` in this approach.
You do not need to locally clone the Git repository, as it will be directly built since OpenShift.
We are going to create an OpenShift `build` executing it:

[source,shell]
----
# To build the image on OpenShift
oc new-app registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift~{quickstarts-clone-url} --context-dir=getting-started --name=quarkus-quickstart
oc logs -f bc/quarkus-quickstart

# To create the route
oc expose svc/quarkus-quickstart

# Get the route URL
export URL="http://$(oc get route | grep quarkus-quickstart | awk '{print $2}')"
curl $URL/hello/greeting/quarkus
----

Your application is accessible at the printed URL.

== Background

The `.s2i/environment` file sets required variables for the S2I Builder image to find the Quarkus `runner` JAR, and copy the JARs from the `lib/` directory.

== Going further

This guide covered the deployment of a Quarkus application on OpenShift using S2I.
However, there is much more, and the integration with these environments has been tailored to make Quarkus applications execution very smooth.
For instance, the health extension can be used for health check; the configuration support allows mounting the application configuration using config map, the metric extension produces data _scrappable_ by Prometheus and so on.
